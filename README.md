# Product landing page

I made this responsive product landing page using HTML and CSS.

The assignment 'Build a Product Landing Page' is a part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum (Responsive Web Design module). The goal was to build a responsive product landing page using plain CSS and by following 15 user stories.

To make it responsive I used media queries and flexbox. The navigation bar switches to a hamburger menu in a mobile view.
